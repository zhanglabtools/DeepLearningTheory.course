# Deep Learning Theory

## About the Course
In recent years, deep learning has made great progress. It is widely used in many fields, such as computer vision, speech recognition, natural language processing, bioinformatics, etc., and also has a significant impact on basic science fields, such as applied and computational mathematics, statistical physics, computational chemistry and materials science, life science, etc. However, it should be noted that deep learning as a black-box model, its ability is explored through a large number of experiments. The theory of deep learning has gradually attracted the attention of many researchers, and has made progress in many aspects.

This course is closely around the latest development of deep learning theory. It intends to teach mathematical models, theories, algorithms and numerical experiments related to a series of basic problems from multiple perspectives of deep learning theory. This course is designed for doctoral, postgraduate and senior undergraduate students in all majors, who have basic knowledge of machine learning and deep learning.
